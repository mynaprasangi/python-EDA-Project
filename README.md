# python-EDA-Project
The bank aims to enhance its revenue by conducting a cost-efficient telemarketing
campaign for term deposits among existing customers. Term deposits, fixed
investments with predetermined interest rates, serve to foster long-term customer
relationships. The objective is to conduct an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
on the campaign dataset, identifying patterns and providing insights to improve the
positive response rate. The analysis will involve examining customer demographics,
temporal trends, and other factors influencing the success of the campaign, ultimately
offering recommendations for targeted improvements in the bank's marketing strategy.
